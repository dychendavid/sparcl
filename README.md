It's a tool for validation formula SPARCL, initiated at 2010. 

No code quality, it was built when I was young, and no more maintain.

## Issue
- Chrome force HTTP to HTTPS, it won't work, please use other browser


## Example Input
- Start Cluster K = 10
- End Cluster k = 3
- Scale, default = 1, if you don't know just leave it empty
- New Source: choose file from input folder, and **DON'T** check new source.
- Draw, Click to submit!
